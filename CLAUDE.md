## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const headersList = await headers()
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params
const searchParams = await props.searchParams
```

### Forms and Actions

- Use Server Actions for form handling
- Implement proper validation with Zod (already available in project)
- Use React Hook Form for complex client-side forms
- Follow progressive enhancement patterns

### Vercel AI SDK Usage

- Use Vercel AI SDK for AI-driven features like chat interfaces, content generation, or semantic search
- Store API keys securely in environment variables (`.env.local`)
- Cache AI responses where appropriate to optimize performance and reduce costs
- Implement proper error handling for AI API calls with fallback strategies
- Use streaming responses for better UX in chat interfaces
- Monitor token usage and implement rate limiting as needed

## UI Components and Styling

### Shadcn/UI and Radix

- Use existing Radix UI components (extensive collection available)
- Follow Shadcn component patterns and customization
- Leverage class-variance-authority for component variants
- Use lucide-react for consistent iconography

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Implement responsive design mobile-first
- Follow design system tokens and spacing
- Use next-themes for dark mode support (available in project)

## Performance and Optimization

- Optimize Core Web Vitals
- Use proper image optimization with Next.js Image
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Monitor bundle size and dependencies

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Strategy

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- Write tests for all components, hooks, Server Actions, and utility functions
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical user paths
- Test accessibility compliance using @testing-library/jest-dom matchers
- Mock external API calls and AI SDK responses in tests

### Test Organization

- Co-locate tests with components (`component.test.tsx`)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Include happy path, error cases, and edge cases

### Testing Commands

- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling Patterns

- Use React 19 error boundaries for client-side component errors
- Implement try-catch blocks in Server Actions with typed error responses
- Return structured error objects: `{ success: false, error: string, code?: string }`
- Provide user-friendly error messages for form validations
- Handle AI API failures gracefully with fallback responses

### Logging Strategy

- Log errors to console in development
- Use structured logging for production environments
- Never log sensitive data (API keys, user passwords, PII)
- Log performance metrics for AI API calls and database queries
- Consider integrating with monitoring services (Sentry, LogRocket) for production

## Accessibility Compliance

### Standards and Testing

- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI components
- Leverage Radix UI's built-in ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- Test accessibility using axe DevTools browser extension
- Run Lighthouse accessibility audits during development
- Use semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy

### Implementation Guidelines

- Provide alt text for all images and meaningful content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Include focus indicators and skip links for keyboard users
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## Environment Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 20.x or later for optimal compatibility
- npm or pnpm for package management
- Git for version control

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Create `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`
3. Add required environment variables (API keys, database URLs)
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Ensure Vercel CLI is installed for deployment: `npm install -g vercel`

### Environment Variables

- Store all secrets in `.env.local` (never commit to git)
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for client-side variables
- Document required environment variables in `.env.example`

### Educational Code Comments

Include detailed comments explaining patterns:
```typescript
// WHY: Supabase real-time gives us live updates across all connected clients
// HOW: Subscribe to table changes and update React state
// LEARN: This replaces polling and provides better UX than traditional REST APIs
const useDocumentSubscription = (userId: string) => {
  const [documents, setDocuments] = useState<Document[]>([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Create real-time subscription for user's documents
    const subscription = supabase
      .channel('documents')
      .on(
        'postgres_changes',
        {
          event: '*', // Listen to all changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
          schema: 'public',
          table: 'documents',
          filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}` // Only get current user's documents
        },
        (payload) => {
          // WHY: Handle different change types to keep UI in sync
          handleDocumentChange(payload)
        }
      )
      .subscribe()
    
    return () => {
      supabase.removeChannel(subscription)
    }
  }, [userId])
  
  return documents
}
```

```typescript
// WHY: RLS policies protect data at the database level, not just in the app
// HOW: Supabase automatically applies these rules to all queries
// LEARN: This prevents data leaks even if frontend code has bugs
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own documents" ON documents
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

// WHY: Signed URLs provide temporary, secure access to private files
// HOW: Generate time-limited URLs that don't expose permanent file paths
// LEARN: This is how modern apps handle secure file sharing
const getDocumentUrl = async (documentPath: string) => {
  const { data } = await supabase.storage
    .from('documents')
    .createSignedUrl(documentPath, 3600) // 1 hour expiry
  
  return data?.signedUrl
}
```
